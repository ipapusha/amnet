# SMT encoder
- [x] Test relu
- [x] Test Constant() (through relu as well)
- [x] Add code coverage

# Trees
- [ ] Add the vgc atom
- [ ] Greedy simplification routines (across linear and stack)
- [ ] Fix issues in the tracker
- [ ] efficient `relu_aff` atom (combine relu() and Affine())
- [ ] efficient `relu_nn` atom (full relu nn)

# TF routines
